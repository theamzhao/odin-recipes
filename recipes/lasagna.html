        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> 
                <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion and garlic in a 
                    Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, 
                    tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tbsp parsley, 
                    basil, 1 tsp salt, italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer,
                    covered, for about 1.5 hours, stirring occasionally.  
                </p>            
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong> 
                <p>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
                    Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, 
                    and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, 
                    remaining 2 tbsp of parsley and 1/2 tsp salt.     
                </p>            
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 3:</strong> 
                <p>
                    Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                </p>            
            </li>
            <li> 
                <strong>Step 4:</strong> 
                <p>To assemble, spread 1.5 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of 
                    a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread
                    with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese
                    slices. Spoon 1.5 cups meat sauce over mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1.5 
                    cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
                    Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover 
                    with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure 
                    it does not touch the cheese.
                </p>
            </li>

                <strong>Step 5:</strong>
                <p>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for 
                    an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
