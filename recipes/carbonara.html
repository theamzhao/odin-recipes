            This dish is a deli egg-bacon-and-cheese-on-a-roll that has been pasta-ified, fetishized
            and turned into an Italian tradition that, like many inviolate Italian traditions, is 
            actually far less old than the Mayflower.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs and 2 large yolks; room temperature</li>
            <li>1 oz (1/3 packed cup) grated pecorino Romano</li>
            <li>1 oz (1/3 packed cup) grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>Coarsely ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>3.5 oz guanciale; pancetta or bacon sliced 1/4 inch thick x 1/3 inch square</li>
            <li>12 oz spaghetti (3/4 box)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> 
                <p>
                    Place a large pot of lightly salted water (no more than 1 tablespoon salt) over high
                     heat, and bring to a boil. Fill a large bowl with hot water for serving, and set aside.
                </p>            
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 2:</strong> 
                <p>
                    In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolks and pecorino and Parmesan. 
                    Season with a pinch of salt and generous black pepper.     
                </p>            
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 3:</strong> 
                <p>
                    Set the water to boil. Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat, 
                    add the pork, and saut√© until the fat just renders, on the edge of crispness but 
                    not hard. Remove from heat and set aside.
                </p>            
            </li>
            <li> 
                <strong>Step 4:</strong> 
                <p>
                    Add pasta to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al dente. Just before 
                    pasta is ready, reheat guanciale in skillet, if needed. Reserve 1 cup of pasta water,
                     then drain pasta and add to the skillet over low heat. Stir for a minute or so.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 5:</strong>
                <p>
                    Empty serving bowl of hot water. Dry it and add hot pasta mixture. Stir in 
                    cheese mixture, adding some reserved pasta water if needed for creaminess. 
                    Serve immediately, dressing it with a bit of additional grated pecorino and pepper.
